SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO
What I'm looking for: a company that wants to see that hiring me = hiring a engaged, conscientious and communicative tester who is a fast learner. I'm looking to work as a manual tester, I'm expanding into test automation. I am interested in long-term cooperation in a close-knit team.
Why testing: I checked if my character traits fit the personality profile of a tester - yes, they fit perfectly. I took part in a testing mentoring program - this confirmed my decision that testing is for me.
About me: I previously worked as a Board Assistant at an IT company. Less than a year ago, I made the decision to change to a tester. I persistently work towards this goal - I learn not only theory, I am most eager to perform practical tasks. I am fascinated by exploring the secrets of how devices and software work.
