# SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO

## What I'm looking for: 
a company that wants to see that hiring me = hiring a engaged, conscientious and communicative tester who is a fast learner. I'm looking to work as a manual tester, developing in the direction of test automation. I'm interested in long-term cooperation in a close-knit team.

## Why testing: 
I checked if my character traits fit the personality profile of a tester - yes, they fit perfectly. I took part in a testing mentoring program - this confirmed my decision that testing is for me.

## About me: 
I previously worked as a Board Assistant at an IT company. Less than a year ago, I made the decision to change to a tester. I persistently work towards this goal - I learn not only theory, enjoy doing practical tasks the most. 
I'm fascinated by exploring the secrets of how devices and software work.
