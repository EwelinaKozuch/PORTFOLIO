# SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Ewelina Ko≈ºuch

## :wave: About me
I previously worked as a Board Assistant at an IT company. Less than a year ago I decided to switch careers to software testing. I persistently work towards this goal - I learn not only theory, enjoy doing practical tasks the most. 
I'm fascinated by exploring the secrets of how devices and software work.

## :eyes: What I'm looking for
A company that wants to see that hiring me = hiring a engaged, communicative and conscientious tester who is a fast learner. I am looking for a job as a manual tester, developing into test automation. I'm interested in long-term cooperation in a close-knit team.

## :point_right: Why testing
I checked if my character traits fit the personality profile of a tester - yes, they fit perfectly. I took part in a testing mentoring program - this confirmed my decision that testing is for me.
